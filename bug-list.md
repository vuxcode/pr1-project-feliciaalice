# Bug List

1. Started out wanting to create a quiz where the user could pick from many different choices, that would include many more functions. Figured out a program like that would be too complicated for my skill level, so I chose to focus the quiz on only one study field, and one "startQuiz" function. 

2. Had to figure out how to properly get the quiz to be displayed in the "quiz container". Solution: document.getElementById('quiz-container') to display the quiz/options/answers etc. 

3. Had a logic bug when adding all options to the if-statements. The questions wouldn't change from the first option (cariology questions). Solution: Figured out that I've just forgotten to write "else if", I only wrote "if".
